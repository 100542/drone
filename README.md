# Building a drone from scratch

Using Arduino & Raspberri Pi, me and 2 others have been working on a autonomous drone. 
The drone should fly on detection of a users face, but can also be manually steered using our selfmade controller.

# Tech Stack

The project uses C++ & Python, where C++ is used for the Arduino board (RC controller & Flight controller), 
and Python is used for the Raspberri Pi to use AI models to support autonomous flying.
